As a mathematician
So I can see pretty results
I want to add two numbers and get "the sum of a and b is result"
```

The below is so I remember what I write in my feature test:
```
require './lib/calculator'
calculator = Calculator.new
calculator.add(1,1)
calculator.add(1,2)
calculator.pretty(1,1)
```
